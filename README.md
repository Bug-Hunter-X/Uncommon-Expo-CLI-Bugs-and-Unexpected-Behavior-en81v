# Uncommon Expo CLI Bugs and Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates some uncommon bugs that may occur within the Expo CLI, characterized by unexpected behavior and unclear error messages. These issues often arise from internal errors within the CLI itself, making debugging challenging.

The `expoBug.js` file showcases an example scenario that might trigger an unexpected error, while the `expoBugSolution.js` file contains potential strategies to mitigate these issues.
