This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and it involves an unexpected behavior or an internal error within the Expo CLI itself, rather than an error in the user's code.  These are harder to debug as they don't always produce clear error messages. For example, a bug might manifest as an unexpected exit code or a failure to start the development server without providing enough information to understand what went wrong.  One particular area for these kinds of bugs is during the build process, especially when dealing with complex project configurations or dependencies.  Another possibility is an interaction between Expo CLI and a specific operating system, hardware, or version of Node.js.
