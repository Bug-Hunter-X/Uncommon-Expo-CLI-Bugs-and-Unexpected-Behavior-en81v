Debugging uncommon Expo CLI errors often requires a systematic approach:

1. **Verify Expo CLI Version:** Ensure you're using the latest version. Run `expo -v` to check and update with `npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli`.
2. **Check Node.js and npm/yarn Versions:** Ensure compatibility.  Check the Expo documentation for supported versions.
3. **Clean Project:**  Remove the `node_modules` folder and reinstall dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn install`).
4. **Check for Conflicting Dependencies:** Look for version mismatches or conflicts between packages in your `package.json`.
5. **Examine Logs:** Thoroughly inspect the Expo CLI logs and any error messages produced, looking for clues to the underlying issue.  Sometimes error details might be hidden within log files.
6. **Simplify the Project:** Create a minimal reproducible example to isolate the problem.  Try removing unnecessary plugins, dependencies, or custom code.
7. **Check Expo Forums/Issues:** See if others have encountered a similar problem. Search the Expo forums or GitHub issues for solutions.
8. **Reinstall Expo CLI:** As a last resort, try reinstalling the Expo CLI globally.

If none of these steps work, you might need to provide detailed information including the operating system, Expo CLI version, Node.js version, and relevant parts of your project to seek help from the Expo community.
